      Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform used by thousands of projects and creators to support the launch and growth of their businesses. In recent decades, crowdfunding platforms have become increasingly popular due to the advancement of technology. Due to this reason, business intelligence plays an essential role in managing and utilizing the data stored in relation to thousands of campaigns and fundraising activities that occur on a daily basis as well as managing and utilizing the data collected. Moreover, business intelligence improves the platform's performance, providing users with continuous value added by being able to analyze acquired data for decision making and analyzing acquired data for decision making and improving the platform's performance.

## üñãÔ∏è Background
<p align="justify">A problem we encountered related to the study object we chose was the difficulty in analyzing and understanding the trends and patterns in crowdfunding projects on the Kickstarter platform. Since thousands of active projects generate a large volume of data at any given time, it is difficult to discern significant trends, identify critical factors, and predict success factors. As a solution to this problem, we have implemented Data Mart as a component of our Data Warehouse System. In Data Warehouse, a Data Mart is a subset that focuses on specific needs of a specific department or business function. By storing Crowdfunding data separately, Data Mart allows us to access and analyze the data more quickly and efficiently since it allows us to store data related to Crowdfunding projects separately. We will implement an interactive dashboard as a Business Intelligence application. This dashboard will provide an overview of crowdfunding project performance, including key metrics such as funding level, number of contributors, and fundraising trends over time. A dashboard with an interactive interface enables users to quickly understand complex information and make informed decisions based on the information presented. Moreover, the interactive capabilities of the application will allow users to explore the data in greater depth according to their specific needs. <p align="justify">

## ‚ùì Analysis Questions ‚ùì
1. What are the project funding trends?
2. What is the most effective funding strategy used by the project?
3. How do experienced creators influence successful projects?

## üèÜ Goals
The main objectives of this project are as follows.
1. Data Collection: Collect data from the Kickstarter platform periodically to cover as many ongoing Crowdfunding projects as possible.
2. Data Mart Creation: Building a suitable Data Mart structure to store and manage Crowdfunding project data efficiently.
3. Dashboard Development: Develop interactive dashboards that allow users to view and analyze Crowdfunding project data intuitively.
4. Trend and Pattern Analysis: Conduct in-depth analysis of Crowdfunding project data to identify trends, patterns, and factors influencing project success.
